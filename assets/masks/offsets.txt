    Implies:
    Offset P1 square by [323, 0] to get P2 square
    Offset P1 square by [0, 240] to get P3 square
    Offset P1 square by [323, 240] to get P4 square

and then automatically creating character masks for all other squares from that.

P1 square width looks to be: about 310 (x) by 236 (y)
