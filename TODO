Current status:
- Add transcode-to-MP4 (using ffmpeg -i ...  -b:v 400k -b:a 96k ....mp4) and
  have the HTML5 video element refer to that file.
- Add processing time to UI
- Rework screens:
  - Put "Import" and "Details" columns onto "All videos" screen,
    then remove "Unimported videos" table.
  - Figure out what else to put onto front page.
  - Add more tables to various screens
  - Add an "all races" screen
  - Make most tables paginated with controls for # to show at once
  - Add a "miscellaneous stats" screen with random interesting stats
    Or (and?) add "all characters" and "all races" screens that show information
    about all of them, which is probably more interesting than looking at only
    one at a time.
  - Add summary by day?
  - Add race and character images where appropriate?
  - Add a master "select these races and show me this information" screen?
- Manually check the full output on all videos -- see "Known Issues" below.
  Previous problem videos include recording-0003.

Quality of life:
- Write a tool for diffing results between two runs on the same race.

Known issues:
- 2012-06-19-00.mov:
  - No position information until 23s into the race (e.g., what about state at
    10s, change at 12s?)
  - Not handling pause around 15s
  - Missing "Yoshi finishes" at 2:29 and "Toad finishes" at 2:30
