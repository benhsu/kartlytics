Current status:
- Manually check the full output on all videos -- see "Known Issues" below.
  Previous problem videos include recording-0003.
- Figure out why kartlytics.com is getting a different result on some videos
  (e.g., 6/19 Recording0000.mov) than my laptop.  (Is this the bug I just fixed,
  where I had to brighten the track masks? Maybe I hadn't brightened them in
  mask_sources, but rather just in assets/masks, which didn't push them up to
  production.)

Quality of life:
- Write a tool for diffing results between two runs on the same race.
- Add a button to the UI for rerunning kartvid?
- Add support for writing out PNG images.
- Add a debug flag that causes kartvid to save PNG image of each significant
  frame.

Known issues:
- 2012-06-19-00.mov:
  - No position information until 23s into the race (e.g., what about state at
    10s, change at 12s?)
  - Not handling pause around 15s
  - Missing "Yoshi finishes" at 2:29 and "Toad finishes" at 2:30
