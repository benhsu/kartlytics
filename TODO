Current status:
- Debugging inconsistency in kartvid's character identification.  I've created a
  small suite of test data in test/, which can be used to automate testing as
  the algorithm is tweaked.
- The next step is to modify "kartvid ident" to emit JSON instead of plaintext,
  and write a little test runner that checks the output for each one (character,
  track, and that the race is starting).
- Check whether the ones we failed to identify correlate with videos taken at
  low quality.  If so, maybe we could punt on these and just make sure to take
  higher quality videos.
- Otherwise, tweak the algorithm or masks: consider using HSV instead of RGB?

- Then manually check the full output on all videos.  Specific problem videos
  include output-1, output-4, and recording-0003.

- Then finish uploading the remaining videos.
- Then add video details, track details, race details views.
