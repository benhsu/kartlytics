Current status:
- Figure out why kartlytics.com is getting a different result on some videos
  (e.g., Recording0000.mov) than my laptop.
- Then manually check the full output on all videos.  Previous problem videos
  include output-1, output-4, and recording-0003.
- Figure out why Yoshi Valley race does the wrong thing (Recording-0008)
