Current status:
- Manually check the full output on all videos.  Previous problem videos include
  recording-0003.
- Figure out why kartlytics.com is getting a different result on some videos
  (e.g., 6/19 Recording0000.mov) than my laptop.

Quality of life:
- Write a tool for diffing results between two runs on the same race.
- Add a button to the UI for rerunning kartvid?
- Add support for writing out PNG images.
- Add a debug flag that causes it to save PNG image of each significant frame
